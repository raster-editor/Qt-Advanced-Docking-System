# Qt Advanced Docking System
You're currently viewing Raster's fork of Qt Advanced Docking System. This is an extremely tightened and CMake-only version of QtADS made specifically for [Raster](https://github.com/raster-editor/raster).

What's been changed:
* removed unnecessary images, documentation etc.
* small layout tweaks
* removed support of QMake and Python

From time to time this fork will be synced with upstream QtADS, do not expect the latest and the best version to be here.

If you want to use Qt Advanced Docking System, please use full version of [QtADS](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System).
In the end you do you, nothing stops you from using this fork <3

Qt Advanced Docking System lets you create customizable layouts using a full
featured window docking system similar to what is found in many popular
integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio.
